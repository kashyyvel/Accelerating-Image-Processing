### INTRODUCTION
Image processing tasks, such as convolution, often require significant computational resources, especially for large images. Parallelizing these tasks can lead to substantial performance improvements by leveraging multiple processing elements simultaneously. This project focuses on accelerating image convolution through parallelization, aiming to improve processing time and efficiency.


### PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Single-threaded Convolution
Baseline time is measured by performing convolution with a single thread.
The time taken serves as a reference for evaluating speedup and efficiency.
Multithreaded Convolution
Convolution is performed with varying image sizes and different numbers of processing elements (threads).
Speedup is calculated as the ratio of single-threaded time to multi-threaded time, indicating the performance improvement achieved through parallelization.
Parallel efficiency is computed as the speedup divided by the number of threads used, providing insights into the scalability of the parallel implementation.
Results and Analysis

### SPEEDUP ANALYSIS
Speedup is plotted against image size (N) and the number of processing elements (threads), demonstrating the performance gains achieved through parallelization.
Efficiency Analysis: Parallel efficiency is evaluated to assess how effectively computational resources are utilized with increasing thread counts.


### CONCLUSION
The results provide insights into the performance characteristics of parallelized convolution for image processing tasks. While parallelization offers significant speedup, optimizing parallel efficiency and scalability remains essential for maximizing performance across different problem sizes and computing environments. Continued research and experimentation can lead to improved parallel algorithms and techniques for accelerating image processing workflows.
